                         Kernel Configuration Menu


           Skip kernel configuration and continue with installation
           Start kernel configuration in full-screen visual mode
           Start kernel configuration in CLI mode


  Here you have the chance to go into kernel configuration mode, making
  any changes which may be necessary to properly adjust the kernel to
  match your hardware configuration.

  If you are installing FreeBSD for the first time, select Visual Mode
  (press Down-Arrow then ENTER).

  If you need to do more specialized kernel configuration and are an
  experienced FreeBSD user, select CLI mode.

  If you are certain that you do not need to configure your kernel
  then simply press ENTER or Q now.
